Math.random() gives us x such that 0 <= x < 1 .... (1)

if min = 1 and max = 5 then x should be a value such that 1 <= x < 5

that can be done by first multiplying 4 (max - min, 5 - 1 in this case) on both sides of equation (1) and adding the min value (in this case 1)

0 <= x < 1
0 <= 4x < 4 (Multiplying by 4)
1 <= (4x + 1) < 5 (Adding 1)

Hence the value we have to return in this case is (4x + 1) where x is a random value returned by Math.random()

This works for any min and max value

if min = 2 and max = 10 then value to be returned will be

x * (max - min) + min
