let date = new Date();

console.log(date);


let date = new Date(0);

represents 0 miliseconds (1/1000 second) from 1st January, 1970



let date = new Date(1000);

represents 1000 miliseconds (1 second) from 1st January, 1970



let date = new Date(60 * 1000);

represents 60 seconds or 1 minute from 1st January, 1970



let date = new Date(60 * 60 * 1000);

represents 60 minutes or 1 hour from 1st January, 1970




Hence, let date = new Date(24 * 3600 * 1000);

represents 1 day (24 hours) from 1st January, 1970  i.e.,  2nd January, 1970


that is why the syntax is new Date(miliseconds)

the integer part in miliseconds is called a TIME STAMP.
